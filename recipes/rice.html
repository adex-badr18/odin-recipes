            <h3>Short Description</h3>
            <p>
                Jollof rice is a delicious royal dish originating in West Africa. It is one of the most common West
                African dishes eaten in the regions of Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory
                Coast, Cameroun, and Liberia. Although it is believed to have originated from the Wolof people in
                northwestern Senegal.

            <h3>Steps to prepare Nigerian Jollof Rice Recipe</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First, make the tomato-based sauce by blending together the red bell peppers (pimento), tomatoes,
                    onion, and scotch bonnet.</li>
                <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat, then add the diced onions and let them cook
                    for about 3 minutes or until they are soft.
                </li>
                <li>Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then stir in garlic, ginger, and bay
                    leaves—leave to cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the blended sauce and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced and the sauce become
                    thick —about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Season with thyme, curry powder, bouillon cubes, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook for another 2 to 5
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the rinsed rice to the sauce and stir until it is well coated with the sauce. Then add the
                    chicken stock, stir briefly, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and bring to a quick boil over high
                    heat.</li>
                <li>Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat immediately to low and steam
                    until the rice is done—about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the butter, sliced tomato, and onions, stir together briefly and turn off the heat. Cover it
                    immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up the vegetables a little.</li>
            </ol>
