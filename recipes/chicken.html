        Chicken Suya made with chicken laps and wings! This popular Nigerian street food recipe is perfect for the summer,
        entertaining or to just enjoy on a weeknight. The chicken is marinated in Suya spice also known as yaji or Suya pepper and

        Suya is the word that describes any skewered, grilled meat in most parts of Africa, particularly Nigeria and Cameroon. 
        The term originated with the Hausa people, one of the largest ethnic groups in West Africa.
        Most suya recipes feature beef. But this chicken version boasts skinless chicken thighs. 
        I think they’re more flavorful than chicken breast, but you can go that route if you want low-fat.

        Suya spice is a popular marinade used on thinly sliced beef and grilled on open fire until well done. 
        It is mostly made by men called Mallam and served at nights. Over time, the mallam started incorporating other protein such as hen and chicken into the mix. 
        They serve this grilled meat with salad wrapped in old newspapers.
