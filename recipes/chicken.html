            <h3>Short Description</h3>
            <p>
                Chicken Suya is made with chicken thighs or chicken wings! This popular Nigerian street food recipe is
                perfect
                for the summer, entertaining or to just enjoy on a weeknight. The chicken is marinated in Suya spice also
                known
                as yaji or Suya pepper and then grilled to perfection with the wings falling off the bones. It is flavourful
                utterly delicious.
                Suya spice is a popular marinade used on thinly sliced beef and grilled on open fire until well done.
                It is mostly made by men called Mallam and served at nights. Over time, the mallam started incorporating
                other
                protein such as hen and chicken into the mix. They serve this grilled meat with salad wrapped in old
                newspapers.
            </p>

                Suya is the word that describes any skewered, grilled meat in most parts of Africa, particularly Nigeria and
                Cameroon.
                The term originated with the Hausa people, one of the largest ethnic groups in West Africa.
                Most suya recipes feature beef. But this chicken version boasts skinless chicken thighs.
                I think they’re more flavorful than chicken breast, but you can go that route if you want low-fat.
            </p>
            <p>
                These African-style chicken satays are smothered in a spicy, flavorful peanut butter sauce, then baked to
                juicy,
                crispy perfection.
                They’re ideal for snacks, summer picnics, or even a main dish. Amazingly good!

            <h3>Steps to prepare Nigerian Chicken Suya Recipe</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep the chicken wings</strong>: Cut it into drumettes and winglets and pat dry with a kitchen
                    towel
                    and transfer to a bowl.</li>
                <li>To the chicken wings, add salt, chicken bouillon powder, 2 tablespoons suya spice and mix into the wings
                    until well
                    combined. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to marinate in a cool place for at least 30 minutes.
                    The
                    longer you
                    marinate the chicken, the tastier it becomes, so feel free to marinate for up to 24 hours in the fridge. <br>

                </li>
                <li>Whilst the wings is marinating, to a small bowl, add the remaining `suya spice and vegetable oil and mix
                    to
                    combine.</li>
                <li>Preheat the grill or oven at 180C/360F and prepare the baking tray, line it with an aluminium foil and
                    place
                    a baking
                    rack on it.</li>
                <li>Arrange the chicken wings on the baking rack, given them enough room so they cook evenly and gets enough
                    air
                    circulation
                    in the oven. <br>

                </li>
                <li>Brush the chicken with the marinade made earlier and grill/broil or bake in the oven for 15 minutes.
                    Take it
                    out of the
                    oven and flip then rub more of the marinade, return into the oven and continue cooking for another 15
                    minutes. For a
                    final time, bring it out of the oven, flip and rub the remaining marinade and grill for another 15
                    minutes. <br>
