        Suya spice is a popular marinade used on thinly sliced beef and grilled on open fire until well done. 
        It is mostly made by men called Mallam and served at nights. Over time, the mallam started incorporating other protein such as hen and chicken into the mix. 
        They serve this grilled meat with salad wrapped in old newspapers.
