            <h3>Short Description</h3>
            <p>
                Jollof rice is a delicious royal dish originating in West Africa. It is one of the most common West
                African dishes eaten in the regions of Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory
                Coast, Cameroun, and Liberia. Although it is believed to have originated from the Wolof people in
                northwestern Senegal.

                This recipe for jollof rice can be customized in many ways to suit your tastes and preferences, you
                could add any of your favorite vegetables (diced carrots, green beans, sweet peas, or sweet corn). It
                can be enjoyed with chicken, beef, lamb meat, goat meat, or fish. I love pairing mine with some fried
                Plantains, coleslaw, and baked chicken!
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s made from rice, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and other seasonings. The dish is cooked in one pot.
                It’s simple and easy to make at home—and the end result is absolutely delicious!

            <h3>Steps to prepare Nigerian Efo Riro Recipe</h3>

            <!--
                






            -->
            <h4>Prep</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>I used smoked dried ponmo for this recipe, you can also use fresh ones if you want. If you are using
                    the dried ones, soak them in warm water for at least 36-48 hours.</li>
                <li>Wash ponmo clean (use wired scourers for easier job) and set aside.</li>
                <li>Pick the vegetable from the stalk and slice into chunks( see photo for reference.</li>
                <li>Rinse vegetable clean, drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Wash locust beans and set aside.</li>
                <li>Chop 1 onion and set aside.</li>
                <li>Shred the smoked fish into flakes and also set aside.</li>
                <li>Blend the peppers with the remaining onions with little water coarsely and set aside (I sieved the
                    blended pepper as I choose not to boil the pepper).</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place a pan on medium heat and add palm oil, heat for about 5 minutes but don’t bleach.</li>
                <li>Add iru woro and chopped onions and fry for about 2 minutes (In this case, I used half of the locust
                    beans and saved the rest before I finished cooking the soup)</li>
                <li>Add the blended pepper to the palm oil and stir to combine, after about 3 minutes, add the remaining
                    locust beans. Add the diced ponmo and ground crayfish and cook for another 3-4 minutes on low heat
                </li>
                <li>Add seasoning (bouillon cube/stock) and pinch of salt. (check for salt at the later stage of the
                    cooking)</li>
                <li>Whilst you are waiting for the sauce to cook, boil water enough to cover the vegetable. Once the
                    water is boiled, pour over the vegetable and cover with a lid for 5 minutes. Strain and squeeze out
                    excess water from the vegetable.</li>
                <li>Continue to cook the sauce till oil floats on the top, add half of the smoked fish and stir to
                    combine. (You can add little water to the sauce if it is too dry but do not over do it as efo riro
                    is almost water free)</li>
                <li>Add the vegetable to the sauce and stir till all is well incorporated.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining smoked mackerel and carefully combine in the vegetable. Check for salt and cook
                    for another 4 minutes.
                    Take it off the heat and set aside. Serve with a swallow of choice or rice and you can even choose
                    to eat it on its own.
